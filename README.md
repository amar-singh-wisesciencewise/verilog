# verilog
verilog code and testbench code


To compile with icarus verilog on linux

use the following commands:
1. iverilog filename.v filename_tb.v
2. vvp a.out


first command should generate the a.out file if there are no errror in the verilog and its testbench code

second command can be executed to simulate and generate the .vcd file which can be opened with GTKWave on linux machines
